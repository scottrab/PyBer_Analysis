## PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to identify different driving and riding trends among different types of cities including rural, suburuban and urban. 

## Results
The accompyning graphs and charts can be seen here: https://github.com/scottrab/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb
To little surprise, the data shows that the fares by city type are greatest for urban cities, then suburban in the middle, and with rural having the lowest $ fare amounts. In addition, we see that the rural riders  actually pay more per ride, about 20-40% more, on average than the other two city types.

## Summary
Based on the results, we can see that there are more drivers and riders in urban areas compared to suburban and rural. With this information in mind, the charges are higher for rural areas to account for the lower ride total.  

## Reccomendations
I would reccomend that the rates for rural areas are increased more temporarily to see if more profit can be made without compromising the amount of riders.  In addition, I would reccomend to continue and even increase drivers in urban areas due to the higher demand. This would also be done to see if more profits can be made.  I final reccomendation I would make would be to make the suburban prices closer to the urban prices to try to close the gap betweeen the two in terms of revenue and average costs per ride.
